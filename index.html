                Adventurous biking is a thrilling activity that involves cycling through rough terrains, steep hills, and challenging trails.

India has some of the most scenic routes for adventurous biking, such as the Leh-Ladakh route and Bhutan to Sikkim route.

            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Paragliding is a sport that involves flying parachutes with design modifications that enhance their gliding capabilities. Unlike hang gliders, their close relations, paragliders have no rigid framework; the parachute canopy acts as a wing and is constructed of fabric cells with openings at the front that allow them to be inflated by movement through the air—the “ram-air” effect.
                <br> <br>
                Some mountain climbers saw paragliding as an alternative to rappelling (abseiling) down after an ascent, while other enthusiasts appreciated its potential as a sport.

            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer, uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore 1. The sport is usually associated with warm ocean beaches like those found in the U.S. states of Hawaii and California, and countries such as Australia.
                <br> <br>
                Today, surfing is enjoyed by millions of people around the world, and is considered by some to be more than just a sport, but a perfectly balanced relationship between humans and the nature.
